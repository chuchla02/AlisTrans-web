                                <p style="font-weight: 100;">Our world is in constant motion. A ceaseless journey of thousands of goods across the whole Europe, Asia and both Americas. Our world is the projects od our customers and daily efforts to always positively surprise you with our commitment. Everything started 20 years ago. In 1992 two friends with a passion for transport took a risk, investing their savings to buy their first two tractor units. Today, with over 50 trucks, we all instill this passion in each other – the owners, the board and over one hundred employees. We are a team based on rules of co-operation, thus we can easier convince carriers to co-operate with us, and they have built, with us, a modern fleet of over 300 vehicles. To be closer to our customers and to effectively co-organize their supply chains, we have created a branch network in Poland and a rapidly growing subsidiary in Germany.</p>

                                <p style="font-weight: 100;">Road transport is the basis for providing our services. We organize domestic and international transport in Europe and Turkey, and our distinguishing feature is the so-called "difficult destinations", i.e. eastern markets, former CIS countries (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan) and Middle East countries (Iran). We provide daily monitoring of the shipment and expert advice at every stage of transport. Each new order is carefully analysed by our specialists to eliminate any errors in planning the transport. Keeping deadlines is one of the main advantages that our Customers value..</p>

                                <p style="font-weight: 100;">Cargo handling in sea freight allows us to deliver goods even to the most remote places in the world. We cooperate with the largest shipowners, and through partner companies that operate on other continents, we guarantee professional order servicing at every stage. We organize full container transports as well as general cargo transports. We help with customs clearance and operations in ports (e.g. picking a container from the port, weighing, returning an empty container). We are able to organize the transshipment of goods and storage in customs warehouses.</p>

                                <p style="font-weight: 100;">Air freight is the most expensive, but also the fastest way to deliver goods. We handle air shipments in import and export, offering our Customers place in the aircraft of the largest airlines. Thanks to cooperation with reliable partners around the world, we provide high quality services and attractive prices for freight and delivery of all types of goods on the majority of trade routes. We pick up the cargo from the Customer, we organize delivery to the airport of departure and the airport of receipt and to the door of the consignee (door-to-door).</p>

                                    <h4>TRUCK TRACTORS + SEMI-TRAILERS</h4>
                                    <p style="font-weight: 100;">This is the most popular option in our fleet. Tractor-trailers are adapted for pulling semi-trailers, which allow transport of goods of large quantity and weight. At the choice of customers, we provide primarily universal semi-trailers (covered with a tarpaulin), but we also have isotherms, refrigerators, dump trucks and open trailers adapted for the transport of oversized goods.</p>

                                <h4>DELIVERY VANS</h4>
                                <p style="font-weight: 100;">
                                    Delivery vans, called minibuses, due to their permissible total weight (up to 3.5t) and the associated convenience in many transport issues, are by far the fastest transport option. Transport of smaller cargo will be cheaper if it is transported with others on a large trailer, but if the customer cares that his goods are not carried with others and the delivery is express, we encourage you to use this option.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                  <h4>TRUCKS</h4>
                                    <p style="font-weight: 100;">We have such cars, commonly referred to as solos, mostly in a tarpaulin version, that is, adapted for transporting cargo resistant to external factors such as temperature. We also have such cars in hard body, equipped with a refrigeration unit. We also have trucks equipped with HDS (hydraulic truck crane)..</p>

                                <h4>LOW LOADER TRAILERS</h4>
                                <p style="font-weight: 100;">Platforms and low-loader trailers, also known as Tieflader or low-loader, are most often used for oversized transport. They are equipped with a flat load deck - located at a low height - overrun ramps or modular systems that allow the semi-trailer to be tailored to the cargo being transported. These are technically advanced vehicles with huge payloads, up to several hundred tons.</p>
